Project: Web Server Cluster with Autoscaling Group , fronted by an Application Load Balancer.
-------------------------------------
Description:

This project is the improvement of the Web SERVER Cluster project in the Book Terraform: Up and Running.

This project mentioned in the book contained outdated steps like Launch Configurations and user_data bootstrapping scripts.

These out-dated steps caused issues with the launching of resources , thus improvements were made to make sure that updated terraform resources in the configuration files can deploy the resources without error.
