Three-Tier Architecture on AWS using Terraform
-----------------------------------------------
Designed and deployed a scalable and secure three-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform. 

The setup includes a VPC with public and private subnets, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets, EC2 web servers in private subnets, and an RDS MySQL database. 

Implemented best practices with security group rules to control traffic between ALB, web servers, and the database, and used a NAT Gateway to enable internet access for private instances. 

This project demonstrates expertise in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and AWS cloud architecture.
