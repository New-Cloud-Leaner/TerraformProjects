Managing Resource Scaling with Dynamic Variables
------------------------------------------------------
You are tasked with creating an auto-scaling EC2 setup using Terraform. The number of instances in the auto-scaling group should dynamically change based on load patterns provided in a CSV file (e.g., min_size, max_size, and desired_capacity).

Task:
------------------------------------------------------
•	Outline how you would ingest data from the CSV file into Terraform and dynamically configure the auto-scaling group.

•	Discuss how you would ensure the solution remains flexible for future changes, like additional scaling policies based on CPU or memory usage.
